# BoardgameCatalogue

## Project Intro

When you have a lot of boardgames it can be difficult to remember what games you can play with n people.

I wanted to create a simple webpage that can filter a collection of games by the number of players it can support, and dip my toes into basic web design and javascript.

## Details

The games are loaded from a JSON file into an HTML table using the javascript fetch()
